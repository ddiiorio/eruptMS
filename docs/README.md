#### Production Deployment Instructions

Pre-install: 
- Create an mssql database which can be accessed by the intended host
- install docker on the users host

Stage 1: checkout

1. checkout source from https://github.com/noah-seltzer/comp4911timesheets
2. CD into comp4911timesheets folder

Stage 2: configure environment files

1. Replace CONNECTION_STRING in /COMP4911Timesheets/appsettings.json with a valid connection string. 
NOTE: as this is a docker depoyment, localhost, 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 will not function the way you may expect. use the IP address of the docker host
2. (optional) In build.yml, Customize the container name from eruptTEST to something more appropriate to your configuration
3. (optional) In build.yml Customize the outgoing port from 5000 to another port.

Stage 3: build container

1. from the outermost project folder, which contains build.yml, run the console command 
`docker-compose -f build.yml up --build`
(optional) in production, run `docker-compose -f build.yml up --build -d`. the -d flag detaches your console from the container
2. Point your browser to localhost:{the-port-you-chose)
